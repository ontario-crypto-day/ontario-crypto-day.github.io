In the spirit of [Bay Area Crypto Day](https://sites.google.com/view/bayareacryptoday/), [NY Crypto Day](https://nycryptoday.wordpress.com/), and others, **Ontario Cryptography Day** aims to bring together the cryptography community in Ontario for a day of research talks and discussions. We hope to establish a recurring event rotating through universities in Ontario.
