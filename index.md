In the spirit of [Bay Area Crypto Day](https://sites.google.com/view/bayareacryptoday/), [NY Crypto Day](https://nycryptoday.wordpress.com/), and others, **Ontario Cryptography Day** aims to bring together the cryptography community in Ontario for a day of research talks and discussions. We hope to establish a recurring event rotating through universities in Ontario.

The event is open to academic, industry, and public sector researchers and practitioners in cryptography, but registration is required.

## Travel

**Parking:** The closest visitor parking to the Davis Centre is [Q Lot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6innGRkyF9o33tRy5), which costs about $7/day and must be paid using the [AMP Mobile pay app](https://uwaterloo.ca/sustainable-transportation/visitors).

**Public transport:**

- [GO Transit](https://www.gotransit.com/en): Some GO Transit buses come directly to campus. For example, there is a GO train departing Toronto's Union Station at 7:34am to Bramalea which connects with a GO bus to the University of Waterloo campus, arriving at 9:50am. There are also GO trains to Kitchener station which connect with GRT buses/light rail from Kitchener to UW. Check the trip planner on the GO Transit website for more details.
- [Grand River Transit](https://www.grt.ca/en/): The ION light rail stops at the [University of Waterloo station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pAdNsNZxX9tB7FN17). There are also many local buses that reach the University of Waterloo campus.
